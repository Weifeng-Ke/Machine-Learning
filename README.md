# Machine-Learning

## This repo will contain 4 main parts:
programming assignments 1,
programming assignments 2,
programming assignments 3,
PixelCNN ++

### Programming assignment 1
Implement 2D convolution in multiple ways, i.e. matrix multiplication in spatial/Fourier domains. 
Implement the gradient of 2D convolution

### Programming assignment 2
Implement a Transformer architecture from scratch.
Implement the transformer and train it on a small task. 
The task is to check if the input strings contain 'c' 'p' 'e' 'n' in the correct order.
